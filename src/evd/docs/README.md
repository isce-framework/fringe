# Maximum Likelihood Estimator using Eigen Value Decomposition

This module estimates the maximum likelihood stack from a given stack of SLCs and a neighborhood map. The stack is expected to be provided as a GDAL VRT file and the neighborhood weights as a single GDAL dataset. 

The output is a complete folder with a single binary dataset for each SLC in the stack. In addition, two other outputs are included in the folder:

1) tcorr.bin - The posteriori coherence
2) compslc.bin - The compressed SLC corresponding to the entire stack


For full details on the processing approach, see references.

## Algorithm

1. For each pixel, a Covariance matrix in time is estimated using the local neighorhood.

2. (MLE) The Covariance matrix is then used with the MLE Estimator to estimate a wrapped phase for each time-epoch in 3 steps
    - Coherence maxtrix is estimated as element-by-element absolute value of covariance matrix
    - The inverse of the coherence matrix is estimated
    - The Hadamard product of the inverse and Covariance matrix is used for further analysis


2. (EVD/ STBAS) In case of STBAS, the bandwidth parameter is used to constrain the Covariance matrix and all entries outside the bands are zeroed out. 
    - The largest eigen vector of the full covariance (EVD) / banded covariance (STBAS) matrix is estimated
    - This is nothing but maximization of Rayleigh quotient in Quadratic/Semi-definite programming. Only the phase of the eigen vector is considered similar to MLE.


3. We have not yet implemented iterative improvements to the phase-linking algorithm. For now, we use the phase of the Eigen vector of the final decompositio. Simple tests with Python show that the iterative improvements are fairly minor (almost none) in most cases.


4. These MLE phase estimates are written out as individual layers. The other related measures like the temporal coherence and compressed SLC are also estimated on a pixel-by-pixel basis and written out.


### Matrix operations

1. We use armadillo cubes / matrices as containers for storing data.

2. For numerical operations, armadillo does not include an efficient way of generating a single eigen vector.

3. Hence, we bound Lapack's [zheevr](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d9/dd2/zheevr_8f.html) method to efficiently estimate single Eigen vectors of interst. 

4. For Hermitian matrix inverse, we use [zportf](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-3.1.1-html/zpotrf.f.html) followed by [zpotri](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-3.1.1-html/zpotri.f.html).

5. All the symbol bindings can be found under [include/fringe/EigenLapack.hpp](../../../include/fringe/EigenLapack.hpp) in the code base. 

6. EVD will need to be linked against lapack and blas/f77blas. On OS X, we rely on atlas to provide these packages. On linux, we have tested this with conda. 


### OpenMP issues

1. Note that most distributions of armadillo ship with OpenBLAS included and it is possible to use openMP optimizations. When armadillo linalg operations are called from within OpenMP loops, they raise warning / error messages. 

2. To turn these off, set environment variable OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1. Note that setting this environment variable permanently may slow down your other armadillo dependent packages. Hence, suggested way to deal with this to include the environment variable as part of your command (see below for usage).

3. We are still working on a way to have python set this environment variable in a reliable way. Looks like the current way of setting the environment variable before importing the cython bound library works but needs verification on different computing platforms.
