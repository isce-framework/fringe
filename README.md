*Fine Resolution InSAR using Generalized Eigenvectors*


FRInGE is a package written in C++ / Python which contains tools to estimate deformation time-series by exploiting interferometric covariance matrice for distributed scatterers (DS)  and the phase history of pixels that exhibit very little temporal variation (PS). Its development was funded under the NASA Earth Surface and Interior (ESI) program (NTR-51454). U.S. Government sponsorship acknowledged.
